# Image Dehazing using Deep Learning

This project implements an image dehazing model using deep learning techniques to enhance the visibility of hazy images.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a neural network to remove haze from images.
- **Image Processing**: Enhances contrast and clarity.
- **Jupyter Notebook Implementation**: Provides an interactive workflow.
- **Visualization**: Compares original and dehazed images.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow keras opencv-python
```

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sachinsonii/Image_Dehazing.git
cd Image_Dehazing
```

## Running the Notebook

Since this project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1. Install Jupyter Notebook if not already installed:
   ```sh
   pip install notebook
   ```
2. Open the notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook image_dehazing.ipynb
   ```
3. Run all the cells in order to train the model and dehaze images.

## Model Overview

- **Input**: Hazy images.
- **Processing**: A deep learning model enhances image quality.
- **Output**: Clear, dehazed images.

## Visualization

The notebook provides side-by-side comparisons of hazy and dehazed images.

## Future Improvements

- Optimize the model for real-time processing.
- Enhance model accuracy with larger datasets.
- Implement a GUI for easier interaction.
